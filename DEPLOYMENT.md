   - Sign in or create an account
   - Go to your dashboard
   - Drag and drop the `out/` folder onto the deployment area
   - Your site will be deployed instantly!

### Option 2: Git Integration (Recommended for ongoing updates)

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:

     - **Publish directory**: `out`
     - **Node version**: `18` (set in Environment variables)

3. **Deploy**: Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site

## PWA Features to Test After Deployment

After deployment, test these PWA features on the live site:

### 🔧 Development Testing (Current)
- ✅ Site loads at http://localhost:3002
- ✅ PWA components render without SSR errors
- ✅ Build includes all PWA files (manifest.json, sw.js, icons)

### 🌐 Production Testing (After Netlify deployment)
- [ ] **Manifest validation**: Check Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest
- [ ] **Service worker registration**: Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- [ ] **Install prompt**: Should appear on supported browsers
- [ ] **Offline support**: Disconnect internet, site should still work
- [ ] **Icon display**: Check all icon sizes in different contexts
- [ ] **Add to home screen**: Test on mobile devices

### 🔍 PWA Audit Tools
Use these tools to validate PWA implementation:
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse (PWA audit)
- Chrome DevTools Application tab
- [Web.dev Measure](https://web.dev/measure/)
- [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
