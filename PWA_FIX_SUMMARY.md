# PWA Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. React Hydration Errors (#425, #418, #423)
- **Problem**: Server-side rendering mismatches causing React hydration failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `ClientOnly` component to prevent SSR issues
  - Wrapped PWA components (`PWAInstaller`, `PWAStatusChecker`, `PWAInstallPrompt`) with `ClientOnly`
  - Removed direct `sessionStorage` access during SSR

### 2. Service Worker Registration Failed
- **Problem**: Service worker MIME type was 'text/html' instead of 'application/javascript'
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `netlify.toml` with proper Content-Type headers for `/sw.js`
  - Added `Service-Worker-Allowed` header for proper scope registration
  - Improved service worker registration with better error handling

### 3. Manifest Syntax Error
- **Problem**: Manifest.json was being served with wrong MIME type
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper `Content-Type: application/manifest+json` header in `netlify.toml`
  - Verified manifest.json syntax is valid

### 4. Service Worker Preload Issues
- **Problem**: Service worker was being preloaded but not used properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated service worker with proper caching strategies
  - Fixed service worker installation and activation events
  - Added proper cache versioning and cleanup

## Files Modified:

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy the updated `out/` directory to Netlify
2. Test PWA functionality on the live site
3. Verify service worker registration in browser DevTools
4. Test install prompt on supported devices
5. Check PWA audit scores in Lighthouse
